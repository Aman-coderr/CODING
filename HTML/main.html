    <h1>Welcome to Kalyug</h1>  
    <p>Kalyug is the generation where people don't care about anyone rather than them. 
        <br>In this Generation people are more obsessed with showoffs rather than doing any worth it Work. <br>Social Media is also a place where people found themselvess lost. <br>It has such bad impacts on your life and health that you will regret it alot later. <br>Even me myself is a victim of Social Media usage. <br>I sometimes try to quit it but it has become very difficult for me to quit it.
